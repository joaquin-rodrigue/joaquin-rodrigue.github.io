                        <p>This Unity game is a demo concept of a 3-dimensional Platform Fighter game, akin to Super Smash Bros.</p>
                        <p>I got to learn both how to implement multiplayer controls and got plenty of practice with Unity coding practices such as coroutines during this project.</p>
                        <p>The fun from this project came from both creating ideas for the different placeholder characters and developing the system behind this game&apos;s combat.</p>

                        <p>This is an old project I&apos;ve recently brought up to speed with more recent projects of mine. This game made in Unity is a 2-dimensional platformer made from scratch in art and programming.</p>
                        <p>I got to work with both programming in Unity and developing art assets, and more recently I&apos;ve updated other aspects of the project using modern Unity features. I also originally developed the project with AR integration via an Ultraleap hand tracking sensor, but unfortunately I have not had much access to it since and these features may be out of date now.</p>
                        <p>This project was really the first full game I made using Unity, I found not only designing the game but building the levels, art, adding in gameplay features, and generally every part of the process was enjoyable.</p>

                        <p>This group project I worked on led to my team recreating Monopoly through a phone-based AR system. We emulated the gameplay from a phone, playable by using a Monopoly board to allow showing off a 3-dimensional monopoly simulation.</p>
                        <p>I worked mostly on developing the AR integration with this project, but also worked on other features of Monopoly such as the player&apos;s ability to get cards and interactions with board squares.</p>
                        <p>Some of the group I worked on this project with are good friends still to this day, and I found the challenge of trying to understand AR and the various hardware problems we encountered alongside it to be fun. The hardware problems were fairly tedious, but otherwise the project was great.</p>
